I like to have collection of tools at my disposal ready to go for whatever need at the time. There's plenty of it out there though buried deep within the internet. This article serves as a collection of the software I have found and continously used to solve some problems I have been facing and make my life easier.

## ShareX
#### Screen Capture, File Sharing and Productivity tool for Windows
[Project Website](https://getsharex.com/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX)

First and foremost, the tool that I use practically all the time while Im on the computer is ShareX. The default Snipping Tool windows provide isn't really useful. The ability to quickly capture in different modes, i.e. a selected region, window, the entire monitor as well as offering GIF/Video recording is pretty useful. On top of that, they allow you to directly edit the image (for region capture anyways) like drawing over or removing/concealling things, as well as adding text. The list goes on, and it doesn't stop there. It has workflows to process the image after capture too, so you could save it in organized directories, format its naming scheme as well as automatically uploading it to image hosting sites. Give it a try, my words here won't do justice of its features.

## KeepassXC
#### Cross-platform Password Manager
[Project Website](https://keepassxc.org/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc)

Tell you what, I don't really trust my browser to store my passwords, and as such I rely on KeepassXC to store my credentials into a secure locally stored database. It's where I keep Passwords, Passkeys, TOTP and whatever other information into databases for me to keep it secure. Not to mention that the software comes with browser extension support, allowing authentication as fast as using the browser's password manager. Then, of course using some tools down the list I can distribute that database across all my devices to make things easy for me.

## Syncthing
#### Open Source Continuous File Synchronization
[Project Website](https://syncthing.net/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)

It is very important to me that my project files are synchronized and stored across multiple devices in the offchance that one fails at least there are other devices that have the valuable data stored, as well as being able to switch between them seamlessly. Syncthing is the solution I used in this case. Depending on how you set up your Syncthing Network, it could just be made into your own Personal Cloud without having to rely on Big Tech! I have 4 distinct folders currently set up, one being my main "Univeral" folder including everything that I find most important, two project folders (3D and Programming respectively) as well as a Minecraft Instances Folder for Prism Launcher. No longer you need to sit there and copy files from one computer to the other when this tool is availbale.

## Rclone
#### Syncing Files to Cloud Storage
[Project Website](https://rclone.org/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rclone/rclone)

It wouldn't be wise for me to have my files only be stored locally, I still wish to put my files into some cloud provider, albeit archived and encrypted so they can't snoop into it easily. Rclone is another part of my recovery setup. Touted to be rsync but with cloud connection, I use this to push my Universal Folder mentioned before to cloud providers as a form of backup solution. At least there are multiple points of failure instead of one this time around.

## gifski
#### Highest quality GIF encoder
[Project Website](https://gif.ski/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ImageOptim/gifski/)

It's an encoder to try and give the best quality GIFs, without the usual visual artifacts that GIFs tend to have. I used this plenty when I was taking commissions of pixel art animations. I have image sequence exports set up from Aseprite and then processed through this program.

## Shutter Encoder
#### An FFmpeg frontend
[Project Website](https://www.shutterencoder.com/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/paulpacifico/shutter-encoder)

I use this for lightweight video editing. The same lightweight video editing I technically would do in FFmpeg CLI but frankly sometimes its just better to give me a UI to work with. It's great. Don't need to open a more heavy piece of software like DaVinci Resolve when I just need to crop and trim videos, or reducing from high to low quality encoding for uploads. 

## Ventoy
#### Specialization is lame, make your USB drive carry multiple ISOs and Data
[Project Website](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy)

I do not like the fact that my 64GB USB Drive can only load one ISO Image file at a time or only store data. Ventoy here allows you to copy over multiple Live Images and boot any of them at your discretion, as well as providing a place to just store regular data. This turns your USB drive into one hell of a multitool, I tend to have system hardware testing images in it, as well as Repair and Recovery Images for damaged systems to rescue important files or fix the system.
