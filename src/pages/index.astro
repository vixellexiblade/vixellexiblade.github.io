  <Card title="Who?">
    Hello! Name's Vix, I've primarily been drawing art for about 5 years now. Though most (94%) of
    my works are not public/hard to access, for the record. This website serves as a faucet to put
    my things publicly as well as being the main connecting hub to and from other sites Im
    associated with.
